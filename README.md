- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ahlam-M , a Mobile Applications Developer

- I develop Android, IOS, Flutter Apps.

- Languages I do speak are: Java, Dart, Kotlin, Swift4+, SQL, C++, C# as well as Arabic, English and Frensh.

- I have a passion for creating things from scratch and watching it until it is fully done as well as deconstructing complex ideas and structures to analyze it and understand how it works, no doubt why I enjoy the process of software development.
